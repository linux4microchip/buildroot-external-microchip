After that in the directory "/home/promwad/microchip_buildroot/buildroot-external-microchip/board/microchip/polarberry" you can find script for board flashing. 

There are 4 scipts:
1) Program_HSS_to_eNVM.sh
2) Program_UBOOT_to_eMMC.sh
3) Program_LINUX_to_eNVM.sh
4) Program_ALL_to_Polarberry.sh

and settings file: FLASH_CONFIG.CONF

Script is used to burn images to the Polarberry board.

The 1th is used to program ONLY HSS bootloader umage to the Polarberry board.
The 2th is used to program ONLY UBOOT image to the Polarberry board.
The 3th is used to program ONLY LINUX (Kernel and root filesystem, bith) image to the Polarberry board.
The 4th is used to program ALL (HSS, UBOOT, LINUX) images to the Polarberry oard.


The 1th script can be used with virgin Polarberry boards and requires ONLY JTAG connection with the board.
The 2th script can be used only after 1th was used (it means UBOOT programming requires HSS was installed before) 
    and requires JTAG and UART connection with the board.
The 3th script can be used only after 2th was used (it means Linux programming requires UBOOT (as HSS toot)
    was installed before) and requires JTAG, UART and ETHERNET connection with the board.
The 4th script runs 1,2,3 one-by-one and do all thunigs that do 1,2,3 in automatic mode and requires JTAG
    UART and ETHERNET connection with the board. Can be used with virgin Polarberry boards too.

Before script can be used, you need to fix values in FLASH_CONFIG.CONF according to your PC.
The file contains strings with comments, so you can advice what you need:

BUILDROOT_DIRECTORY	- here you need to set PATH to the buildroot you are using
UART_DEVICE		- here you need to set the name of the UART in your system. (/dev/ttyUSB1 for example)
DEVICE_IP		- here you need to set IP ADDRESS that will be set on the board during flashing.
                          It shall be one of the free/unused IP addresses from you network.

PC_IP			- here you need to set IP ADDRESS of the PC you are using. (It can be obtained via "ifconfig" command)
IMAGE_NAME		- here you need to set file name with LINUX image that is placed on the TFTP server
                          (default value is "fitimage_polarberry.itb", and this file is built by buildroot and placed in "output/images" directory)


To start building images via buildroot you need to run this command in buildrood sources:
1) "make sundancedsp_polarberry_defconfig  BR2_EXTERNAL=../buildroot-external-microchip"
   (where BR2_EXTERNAL shall point to the mbuildroot microsemi sources).

2) "make"
    Building will take time. Succesfull building will finish like this:

To flash the images to the Polarberry board:
1) Fix FLASH_CONFIG.CONF file in the board/microchip/polarberry directory.
2) Power ON the Polarberry board
3) run "Program_ALL_to_Polarberry.sh", and wait until all finished.
